# bennyraccoon-site
The website for Benny Raccoon and all its Dungeons and Dragons stuff

To create the site:
1. Create the project using Next.js, TailwindCSS and ReactJs to later deploy it to Vercel
  Tutorial of how to do it, step by step https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation
    - Next js is the node framework for delivering sites
    - ReactJS is a javascript framework 
    - TailwindCSS is a css library that will help us style it faster
    - We are not using ESlint or Typescript
2. Following the guide in Figma https://www.figma.com/design/9dG0Gq0m2YcFzyvQPuVy5q/Untitled?node-id=1-2&t=3i1xVDY6oJD3TjNq-1
  Create a styling that resembles this one

Let's do it! :)
